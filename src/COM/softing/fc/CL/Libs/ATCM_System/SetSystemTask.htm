<p>None</p>

<p>None</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p><b>SetSystemTask</b> declares the calling task as a system task. </p>
<p>System tasks are given priority over other tasks. Declaring a task as a system 
  task prevents, for example, that this task changes to an error state or is blocked 
  if the system is already occupied with several tasks running parallelly. System 
  tasks are therefore especially suitable for controlling important processes 
  that must be executed in any case and for monitoring the execution of other 
  tasks. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that a system task must always be declared before all other statements 
  of the corresponding <i><b>POU</b></i>. System tasks are not checked for deadlocks 
  during runtime, which means that if a system task blocks, it can block the entire 
  operating system. </p>
