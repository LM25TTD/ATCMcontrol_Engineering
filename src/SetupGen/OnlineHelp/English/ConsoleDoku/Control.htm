  Establishing/Interrupting a Connection </h2>
<h4>Establishing a connection</h4>
<p class="nachoben">For initialization of the variables, each ATCM Control must 
  be connected with ATCM Engineering. In ATCM Engineering, ATCM Control is represented 
  as a PC. To be able to monitor the variable and its messages in the Watch view 
  of ATCM Engineering, you have to be connected to the corresponding ATCM Control 
  (PC). In this case, you work online, i.e. with an established connection.</p>
<p> Go to the Message view and click on the respective <strong>PC</strong> tab.<br>
  Then click on the <img src="pic/IcConnect.gif" width="22"  height="22"> <strong>Connect</strong> 
  button to establish the connection to the PC. </p>
<p> <i>- OR - </i></p>
<p>click on <strong>Connect</strong> and the desired PC in the menu item <strong>Control</strong> 
  in the main menu. </p>
<p>As soon as the PC is connected with the ATCM Engineering tool, the <img src="pic/IcPC.gif" width="17" height="14"> 
  <strong>PC</strong> symbol in the Navigator view changes to the <img src="pic/IcPCconnect.gif" width="20"        height="14"> 
  <strong>PC-Connect </strong> symbol. </p>
<h4><a name="ruptus"></a>Interrupting a connection</h4>
<p>If you interrupt the connection between the PC and the ATCM Engineering tool, 
  you can no longer monitor its variables and messages in the Watch view of the 
  ATCM Engineering tool. You can also work offline, i.e. without connection to the 
  PC; it is not necessary for you to be online when you edit or compile a project. 
</p>
<p>Go to the Message view and click on the respective <strong>PC</strong> tab.<br>
  Then click on the <img src="pic/IcConnect.gif" width="22" height="22"> <strong>Disconnect</strong> 
  button to interrupt the connection to the PC</p>
<p> <i>- OR - </i></p>
<p>click on <strong>Disconnect</strong> and the desired PC in the menu item <strong>Control</strong> 
  in the main menu. </p>
<h4><a name="debugact"></a>Enabling a debug connection</h4>
<p class="nachoben">Before you can debug and download your code onto ATCM Control, 
  a <strong>Debug connection</strong> must be established. During a debug connection, 
  only <strong>one</strong> ATCM Engineering is permitted to be connected to one 
  ATCM Control. Remember to interrupt the debug connection after having finished 
  a download or a debugging session so that a connection can be established from 
  other ATCM Engineerings as well. </p>
<p>Go to the Message view and click on the respective <strong>PC</strong> tab.<br>
  Click on the <img src="pic/debug.gif" width="22" height="19"><strong> Enable 
  Debug</strong> button to establish a new debug connection, </p>
<p><i>- OR -</i></p>
<p>click on <strong>Enable Debug</strong> in the <strong>Control</strong> menu 
  in the menu bar. Then select the desired PC. </p>
<p>When the debug connection has been established, the connection symbol in the 
  Message view changes to the <img src="pic/DebugInfo.gif" width="25" height="19"> 
  symbol. </p>
<h4><a name="debugend"></a>Interrupting a debug connection</h4>
<p class="nachoben">When you interrupt the debug connection, the exclusive connection 
  to the control is also interrupted. This means that the control continues to 
  be connected to ATCM Engineering, but other ATCM Engineerings now have access to 
  the control as well. </p>
<p>Go to the Message view and click on the respective <strong>PC</strong> tab.<br>
  Click on the <strong><img src="pic/DebugRemove.gif" width="22" height="19"> 
  Disable Debug</strong> button to interrupt the exclusive connection </p>
<p><i>- OR -</i></p>
<p>click on <strong>Disable Debug</strong> in the <strong>Control</strong> menu 
  in the menu bar and select the desired PC. </p>

  Starting/Stopping all Tasks</h2>
<img src="pic/note.gif"
        width="32" height="31" align="left">

    <tr> 
      <td class="HinweisText"> Before you can use the start/stop function, a connection 
        to the PC must have been established. </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p> For trouble shooting during project installation, it may be necessary to start 
  and stop ATCM Control on a PC. Starting or stopping ATCM Control means to start 
  or stop, respectively, all resources of the assigned configuration simultaneously.<br>
  The starting/stopping function should not be used during normal operation but 
  only during the installation of the project. </p>
<p>In the main menu, go to the menu item <strong>Control</strong>. Depending on 
  the current action of the configuration, click either on <strong>Start all Tasks</strong> 
  or on <strong>Stop all Tasks</strong>. <br>
  If ATCM Console is opened, you can monitor the status signals of the tasks in 
  the <a href="faceplate.htm#tasklist">Task list</a> faceplate and 
  in the <a href="faceplate.htm#ressource">Resource list</a>. You 
  can display these by clicking on the <img src="pic/IcProject.gif" width="16" height="15"> 
  project symbol in the Navigator of ATCM Console.<br>
  Now you have started or stopped, respectively, all tasks of this resource.</p>
<h2><a name="run"></a><a href="#overview"><img src="pic/jump.gif" border="0" width="11" height="9"></a> 
  Running/Stopping ATCM Control </h2>
<p>To stop a running ATCM Control, go to the menu item <strong>Control</strong> 
  in the main menu and click on <strong>Stop Control</strong>. ATCM Control is stopped 
  as shown by its symbol <font face="arial"><img src="pic/iccontrolyellow.gif" width="16" height="16"></font>. 
</p>
<p> Stopping ATCM Control offers the following advantages: </p>
<ul>
  <li> The connection to all PROFIBUS slaves is interrupted. This gives you the 
    possibility of reconfiguring the slaves or configuring additional ones.</li>
  <li>You can operate or write all variables in ATCM Console or ATCM Engineering, 
    even when ATCM Control is in a resting phase. </li>
  <li>All current variable values are stored. You can change the value of each 
    variable without changing the project. This gives you the possibility of trying 
    out different values and observing the results. If the values do not fit, 
    just reset them. As soon as you start ATCM Control, all altered variables are 
    reset to their previous values. </li>
  <li>The configuration components do not start automatically after the download. 
    You can compile the entire configuration and start after having configured 
    all components.</li>
</ul>
<p> To start ATCM Control, go to the menu item <strong>Control</strong> in the main 
  menu and click on <strong>Run Control</strong>. <br>
  The ATCM Control symbol changes from yellow to green.</p>

  Reset with Cold Start/Warm Start </h2>
<h4><a name="StartingCold"></a>Cold start</h4>
<p class="nachoben">If the current project does not run properly on ATCM Control, 
  it may be necessary to reset all variables. By means of the cold start function, 
  you can restart the project; this means that all variables are reset to their 
  initial values. </p>

        failure (VAR RETAIN). </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p> In the menu item <strong>Control</strong> of the main menu, click on <strong>Cold 
  Start Reset</strong> and the desired PC. <br>
  All variables are reset and the project is restarted with the initial values. 
</p>
<h4><a name="StartingWarm"></a>Warm start</h4>
<p class="nachoben">With the warm start function, you can reset all variables 
  loaded onto ATCM Control to their initial values. The only exception are the retain 
  variables (VAR RETAIN) which are written on the hard disk in regular intervals 
  for reasons of safety. They are initialized with the last valid value before 
  the warm start.</p>

<p>If you have to delete the running project from ATCM Control, use the Clear function 
  to do this. This function deletes the entire ATCM Control. All project components 
  are deleted so that ATCM Control retains no parts of the project. </p>
<p>Go to the Message view, click on the tab of the corresponding <strong>PC</strong>
