  Structure</h2>
<p>ATCM Console is an application embedded in the Internet Explorer. The graphical 
  surface of ATCM Console is implemented by means of HTML, ASP, Java Script and 
  VB Script and represented as an HTML page in the window of the Internet Explorer. 
  Basically, all operational elements and the entire functionality of the Internet 
  Explorer are therefore available to you when you work with ATCM Console. Except 
  for the <b>Context</b> menu, however, a Console window started from ATCM Engineering 
  contains only the ATCM Control-specific operation and visualization elements. 
  Part of the Internet Explorer functionality is replaced by a group of buttons 
  with the most important navigation functions. For details on this group of buttons, 
  see the section <a href="#IEPanel">Internet Navigation Menu in ATCM Engineering</a>. 
  For navigating in ATCM Console by means of the Internet functions, see <a href="#navigate">Navigating 
  in the Visualization View</a>. </p>
<p>The actual user interface of ATCM Console starts underneath the menu bar and 
  the toolbar of the Internet Explorer and is divided into 4 areas: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#NaviView">Navigator View</a> (left side of the user interface)</li>
  <li><a href="#VisuView">Visualization Area</a> (right side of the user interface, 
    generally divided into several display modules) 
  <li><a href="#Toolbar">Toolbar</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Statusbar">Status bar</a></li>
</ul>

  The Visualization View</h2>
<h3><a name="NaviEtVisu"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Correlation Between Visualization and Navigator View</h3>
<p>There is a strong interdependence between the Visualization and the <a href="#NaviView">Navigator 
  view</a>. Whereas in the Visualization view, process data loaded onto ATCM Control 
  are displayed and, in some cases, represented graphically, the Navigator view 
  determines which data can be seen in the Visualization view. In accordance with 
  the object hierarchy of the ATCMControl programming model, data can be assigned 
  to objects (e.g. function blocks, programs, tasks, resources) and grouped. Accordingly, 
  process data supplied by ATCM Control are also visually grouped for presentation 
  in the Visualization view; the groups correspond with this programming model. 
  The object represented by a visualization group is selected by means of the 
  Navigator view which displays the objects contained in the project in tree topology 
  in accordance with the hierarchy of the IEC programming model. Each object in 
  the tree topology is a hyperlink; by clicking on an object in the Navigator 
  view, you can change to the representation of a visualization group in the Visualization 
  view. </p>
<p> An individual visualization group, which in the following will be called &quot;display&quot;, 
  can be recognized by the gray frame around it. Size and position of the displays 
  can be altered. If you start ATCM Console for the first time, the displays are 
  empty at first; the title bars of the displays accordingly read <i>Empty</i>.</p>
<img src="pic/4CConsole.gif" width="560" height="528" class="inP"> 
<h3><a name="LoadObject"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Loading and Visualizing Objects in a Display</h3>
<p>To load the process data of an object into one of the empty displays, click 
  in the Navigator view on an icon behind which you find a blue underlined term. 
  You can also click on the term itself instead of the icon. The blue color and 
  the underlining signalize that this object is a link for which, if it is enabled, 
  the corresponding process data are shown on the currently enabled display. <br>
  In the <a href="#NaviView">Navigator view</a> section, you can see which objects 
  are available for visualization in the Navigator view and in what hierarchy 
  they are arranged. </p>
<p>The process data of an object which you have clicked on in the navigator are 
  always loaded into the currently enabled display. You can recognize the currently 
  enabled display by the yellow color of the title bar; the title bars of disabled 
  displays are blue. The next display is already enabled while the data are loaded; 
  the previously enabled display changes back to the disabled status. This means 
  that if you click on the next object in the navigator, the process data of this 
  object are loaded into the next display. As a rule, objects are inserted from 
  left to right and, if there are several rows and the last display of a row has 
  been reached, from top to bottom.</p>
<img src="pic/Faceplateorder.gif" width="505" height="570" class="inP"> 
<p>However, you do not have to adhere to this standard order. You can also define 
  into which display an object is to be inserted by specifically enabling this 
  display.</p>
<p>This is how you can enter an object into a display which has been freely selected 
  by you:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click in the title bar of the desired display with the left mouse button. 
    By a color change, the title bar signalizes that the display is now enabled.</li>
  <li>Click on the desired object in the Navigator view of ATCM Console. The selected 
    object is inserted in the currently enabled display. The title bar of the 
    display contains the name of the object.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this manner, you can also assign a different object to the display if object 
  data are already visualized in this display. To do this, simply enable the desired 
  display by means of a mouse click in its title bar and select a different object 
  in the Navigator view. </p>
<p>Displays cannot only be visualized in ATCM Console but also in a separate window 
  outside ATCM Console.<br>
  To do this, click in the Navigator view on the desired object while keeping 
  the <b>CTRL</b> key pressed. The display is now represented as a separate window.</p>
<img src="pic/FaceplateExtra.gif" width="371" height="457" class="inP"> 
<p>Size and arrangement of the displays can be changed by means of the <a href="Layout.htm#EditLayout">layout 
  editor</a> and the context menu. To do this, see the chapter on <a href="Layout.htm">Layouts</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="NaviView"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  The Navigator View</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 5; position: relative; top: 0"> 
  <p>The display in the <a href="#VisuView">Visualization view</a> is controlled 
    via the Navigator view. It represents the objects contained in your project 
    (function block instances, programs, tasks etc.) in tree topology. All objects 
    are displayed with an icon and the name of the object. Most object names are 
    underlined and represented in blue. This is to signalize that these object 
    representations are hyperlinks by means of which the data of the selected 
    object can be loaded and visualized in a display. </p>
  <p>To load the data of an object in a display, proceed as follows: </p>
</div>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <div style="margin-left: 5; position: relative; top: 0">In the Visualization 
      view, enable the display in which the object is to be represented by clicking 
      on its title bar. If you do not explicitly enable a display, all subsequent 
      actions refer to the display which is enabled according to the standard 
      order indicated by the Visualization view (see <a href="#LoadObject">Loading 
      and Visualizing Objects in a Display</a>).</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div style="margin-left: 5; position: relative; top: 0">Click on the desired 
      object in the Navigator view. The object is shown in the previously enabled 
      display. </div>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The Navigator view is divided into the tabs <b>Project</b> and <b>Function 
  Blocks</b>. Both contain the objects of the project loaded on ATCM Control in 
  tree topology. The organization of the tree topology differs in the two tabs. 
</p>
<h3><a name="TabProject"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  The Project Tab</h3>
<img src="pic/Project.gif" width="238" height="394" align=left class="inP" style="margin-right: 15px"> 
<p>As a whole, the Project view is the same as the Instance view of the ATCM Engineering 
  navigator. In both views, the objects arranged in tree topology are displayed 
  according to the programming model structure of ST or FBD. Levels of the tree 
  topology correspond to the object or calling hierarchy of a project. Tasks, 
  for example, can call program instances, which in turn call function block instances 
  etc. Every called object is accordingly represented one level below the calling 
  object. In the following, you will find a survey of the objects organized in 
  tree topology. For details on the visualization of these objects in the displays, 
  see the chapter on <a href="faceplate.htm">Displays</a>.</p>
<p>On top of the tree topology, you will find the <b>project icon with the project 
  name</b>. Since only the objects contained in the project but not the entire 
  project can be represented in the Visualization view, clicking on the project 
  icon or name has no effect on the representation in the Visualization view. 
</p>
<p>Directly underneath the project icon, there is always the <b>configuration 
  list</b>. It is not displayed in the Instance view of ATCM Engineering. If you 
  have a license for multiple configurations, a project can contain several configurations. 
  The configuration list gives a survey of all configurations in a PC if they 
  have been loaded onto a control. If a valid configuration has been created in 
  the project and assigned to a PC but the configuration has not been loaded onto 
  the assigned control, this configuration is not listed. </p>
<p>The <b>configurations</b> in a project are always on the same hierarchical 
  level in the tree topology as the configuration list, but always underneath 
  the same. In the tree topology, only one configuration at a time can be expanded 
  by means of a mouse click on the positive sign; all other configurations have 
  no positive sign. Instead, the other configurations are marked as hyperlinks 
  by underlining and the blue color. A click on the link, however, does not lead 
  to a presentation of the configuration in the currently enabled display, as 
  usual, but the positive sign for expanding a configuration changes to the configuration 
  you have clicked on. In this manner, the objects under this configuration can 
  now be expanded in the tree topology and loaded in a display, but the objects 
  belonging to the previous configuration are now invisible. </p>
<p>Underneath the configuration, the <b>resource</b> assigned to this configuration 
  is displayed. By a click on this hyperlink, information on the runtime status 
  of the resource is shown in the enabled display. </p>
<p>One or more tasks are assigned to each resource. On the next level underneath 
  the resource, you will therefore find the <b>task list</b> which contains a 
  list of all tasks assigned to the resource. </p>
<p>The <b>message history</b> under the task list contains a list of the ATCM Control- 
  and user-defined messages referring to the resource above the message history.</p>
<p>The next level consists of the <b>tasks</b> mentioned in the task list. Since 
  one resource can contain more than one task, several tasks can be displayed 
  one under the other on this level in the tree topology. </p>
<p>In turn, several <b>programs</b> can be assigned to a task. Each task can therefore 
  be expanded. After the expansion, the program instances called by the task can 
  be seen in the tree topology one level below the task. </p>
<p>Programs, in turn, can call <b>function block instances</b>. After expansion 
  of the program branch, the function block instances called by a program are 
  therefore displayed on the next level.<br>
  Function block instances make up the last level of the tree topology. Since, 
  however, function block instances can again call other instances of function 
  blocks or structures, the tree topology can branch out from this point to any 
  depth, depending on the calling hierarchy and on the extent to which the function 
  block calls are nested. </p>
<p> <b>Instances of structures</b> are displayed one level below the function 
  block instance in which the corresponding structure instance was declared. </p>
<h3><a name="TabFB"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  The Function Blocks Tab</h3>
<img src="pic/FunctionB.gif" width="238" height="140" align="left" class="inP" style="margin-right : 15px"> 
<p>The Function Block view is a reduced version of the project structure represented 
  in the Project view. Here, only the function block instances contained in a 
  project are displayed in tree topology. As in the Project view, the organization 
  of the tree topology levels corresponds to the calling hierarchy for a project. 
  Calling function block instances are always one level above called function 
  block instances in the tree topology. Calling function block instances can therefore 
  be expanded by means of the positive sign. Under the expanded function block 
  instance, the called function block instances are displayed. <br>
  Both instances of user-defined function blocks and of function blocks from standard 
  libraries are shown. <br>
  Instances of structures are displayed one level below the function block instance 
  in which the corresponding structure instance was declared.</p>

  The Internet Navigation Menu in ATCM Engineering</h2>
<p>If ATCM Console is started from ATCM Engineering, the Console window is opened 
  without the menu bar and the toolbar of the Internet Explorer. Part of the functionality 
  of the Internet Explorer is therefore replaced by the buttons in the Internet 
  navigation menu located in the toolbar of ATCM Engineering (see also the section 
  on <a href="#InternetFunctions">The Internet Functions</a>). If no window of 
  ATCM Console is opened in ATCM Engineering, these buttons are disabled. If, on the 
  other hand, several windows of ATCM Console are opened, the functions of the buttons 
  always refer to the Console window in the foreground. </p>
<img src="pic/InetButton.gif" width="142" height="21" class="inP"> 
<p>These functions are listed in the following table:</p>

<h2><a name="InternetFunctions"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  The Internet Functions</h2>
<p>ATCM Console is an application embedded in the Internet Explorer. If you work 
  with ATCM Console, therefore, practically all functions offered by the Internet 
  Explorer without ATCM Console are available to you. You can use some of these 
  functions to control the Navigator and Visualization views. For functions of 
  the Internet Explorer which are not documented in this section, see the Internet 
  Explorer help. </p>
<h3><a name="Refresh"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Updating the Navigator and Visualization Views</h3>
<p>The objects displayed in the Visualization view are automatically updated within 
  a defined cycle time. If, however, new objects or variables have been created 
  in the project after a complete or an incremental download, these new elements 
  are not automatically displayed in ATCM Console. Variables which have been newly 
  created within a function block before the download, for example, do not automatically 
  appear after the download in the display for the corresponding function block. 
  Neither are new objects in the Navigator view automatically inserted in the 
  tree topology. To draw your attention to this fact, the red flashing message 
  <i>DOWNLOAD</i> is displayed in the status bar after a new download. To be able 
  to monitor, after a download, the newly loaded elements in ATCM Console as well, 
  you have to update the views of ATCM Console. After updating, the <i>DOWNLOAD	
  </i> message disappears. <br>
  Deleted variables are not removed from the display after a download, but they 
  signalize the OPC quality <i>bad</i> (see also the section on <a href="VQuality.htm">Variable 
  Quality</a><i> </i>)<i> </i>. To display the data organization of an object 
  loaded in a display, which is valid after the download, you have to manually 
  update the corresponding display or the entire Visualization view.<br>
  If you remove an entire object (e.g. function block or task) from the project 
  before a download, the message <i>The object &lt;object name&gt; has been removed</i> 
  appears after the download in the display assigned to this object. In this case, 
  you have to assign a new valid block to the corresponding display. </p>
<p>To update the Navigator view as well as the entire Visualization view, click 
  on the <b>Update</b> button in the Internet Explorer toolbar if you have started 
  ATCM Console outside ATCM Engineering, </p>
<p><i>- OR -</i></p>
<p>click on the <img src="pic/IcRefresh.gif" width="14" height="15" align="bottom"> 
  button for page updating in the Internet navigation menu of ATCM Engineering if 
  you have started ATCM Console from ATCM Engineering. </p>
<p>In addition to updating the entire Navigator and Visualization views, you also 
  have the possibility of updating individual displays. The download message, 
  however, does not disappear after updating of an individual display. </p>
<p>To update an individual display, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click in the display area of the desired display with the right mouse button 
    to open the <strong>Context</strong> menu. The called <b>Context</b> menu 
    is a menu of the Internet Explorer. The options mentioned in the menu refer 
    to the selected display.</li>
  <li>Click on <b>Update</b> in the <b>Context</b> menu. Since the <b>Context</b> 
    menu refers exclusively to the selected display, only this display is updated. 
  </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="navigate"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Navigating in the Visualization View</h3>
<p>If you replace the objects loaded in the displays of the Visualization view, 
  i.e. if you load other objects into the displays instead of the ones displayed 
  before, you can undo the last changes step by step by means of the standard 
  functions of the Internet Explorer, i.e. you can reload the object displayed 
  previously into the corresponding display. </p>
<p>If you have started ATCM Console outside ATCM Engineering, use the <b>Back</b> 
  button in the toolbar of the Internet Explorer to do this. With each click on 
  <b>Back</b>, you undo a change in reverse order as compared to the order in 
  which you have carried through the changes. In each display in which you have 
  loaded a new object, the previously loaded display is therefore redisplayed. 
  <br>
  Similarly, you can navigate with the <b>Forward</b> button in the toolbar of 
  the Internet Explorer through the displayed objects, this time in reverse order. 
  Changes in the displays which you have undone by <b>Back</b> are thus restored. 
  The <b>Forward</b> button is only enabled if you have already carried through 
  changes by <b>Back</b>.</p>
<p>If you have started ATCM Console from ATCM Engineering, the <img src="pic/ForwBack.gif" width="41" height="17" align="top"> 
  buttons in the <a href="#IEPanel">Internet Navigation Menu of ATCM Engineering</a> 
  offer you the same functionality as the <b>Back</b> and <b>Forward</b> buttons.</p>
