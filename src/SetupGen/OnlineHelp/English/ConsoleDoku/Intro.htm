<h1> Introduction</h1>
<p>ATCM Console is the visualization module for project data loaded on ATCM Control. 
  The project data are displayed in visualization units which correspond to the 
  objects defined in the IEC programming model. To each type of object (e.g. task 
  or function block), a specific visualization scheme (in the following called 
  display) is assigned which determines what data assigned to the object are visualized 
  in what form. The visualized data cannot only be monitored but they can also 
  be changed, to a certain extent, during the runtime of a project loaded on ATCM 
  Control.The runtime behavior of a project (starting and stopping tasks etc.) 
  can also be influenced via operational elements of the visualization schemes.</p>
<p>For data transfer, ATCM Console uses the OPC interface and for visualization, 
  the functionality of the Internet Explorer (including Java, Java Script, VB 
  Script, ASP, HTML). The user interface of ATCM Console is integrated in the Internet 
  Explorer so that, in addition to ATCM Console-specific functions, also the functions 
  of the Internet Explorer are available to you. </p>
<p>The cooperation between OPC interface and Internet Explorer functionality makes 
  it possible to not only monitor projects loaded on the control of the local 
  computer but also to monitor and control projects, independent of the location, 
  which are executed on the control of any remote computer, under the prerequisite 
  that the Console computer has Internet access and is connected to an NT domain. 
  For this purpose, neither ATCM Engineering nor ATCM Control need to be installed 
  on the computer on which ATCM Console is executed. </p>
