  Working with Layouts</h2>
<p>Layouts form the basic structure for the arrangement of the displays shown 
  in the Visualization view. The arrangement of displays can be altered via the 
  <b>layout editor</b> or via the <b>Context</b> menus of the displays in the 
  Visualization view. </p>
<p>Alterations of layouts are always carried out on the basis of the currently 
  enabled layout. The enabled layout is indicated in the <b>Layout</b> list box 
  in the ATCM Control toolbar. If you have not yet stored any new layout, the basic 
  layout is the standard layout used by ATCM Control. </p>
<p>Alterations of the layout which have been carried through via the layout editor 
  or via the <b>Context</b> menu of the displays are not automatically stored. 
  As soon as you update the entire Visualization view via the corresponding option 
  in the Internet Explorer or restart ATCM Console, the displays are again arranged 
  in the order of the currently loaded layout. To maintain layout changes, you 
  have to explicitly store the layout. <br>
  For saving and loading a layout, see also the sections: <a href="#SaveLayout">Saving 
  Altered Layouts</a> and <a href="#LoadLayout">Loading a saved Layout</a><b>. 
  </b></p>
<p>Every time you start ATCM Console, the displays are arranged on the basis of 
  the last used layout. If you have not yet created and saved a new layout, the 
  standard layout of ATCM Console will be used for the arrangement of the displays.</p>
<h2><a name="EditLayout"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Editing a Layout in the Layout Editor</h2>
<p>To edit a layout, start the <b>layout editor</b> by clicking on the <b>Edit</b> 
  button in the toolbar of ATCM Console or on the <b> Edit Layout </b>option in 
  the <b>Context</b> menu of any display. </p>
<img src="pic/ViewEditor.gif" width="450" height="600" class="inP"> 
<p>The arrangement of the displays which is shown in the layout editor always 
  corresponds to the layout that is currently displayed in ATCM Console, even if 
  the latter has not been saved yet. If you have not yet edited any layout in 
  ATCM Console, see the structure shown in the above figure. It is identical with 
  the standard layout used in ATCM Console. In the figure below, you can see the 
  display arrangement, which is based on this layout, in the Visualization view:</p>
<img src="pic/StandardLayout.gif" width="442" height="346" class="inP"> 
<p>As you can see by comparing the two figures, one display corresponds to a row 
  of squares with the same color and number in the layout editor. In the above 
  figure, therefore, the first display from the left is represented in the layout 
  editor by the gray squares with the number <i>1</i>, the second display by the 
  blue squares with the number <i>2</i> etc. </p>
<p>You can change the size and position of the displays in the layout editor. 
  To do this, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>On the very top of the layout editor, there is a row of numbered colored 
    squares. Each square stands for a separate display. Click on one of these 
    squares with the left mouse button. This square is now displayed similar to 
    a pressed button; this is to signalize that it is enabled. </li>
  <li>The area underneath these squares represents the layout displayed in the 
    Visualization view. The layout is divided into 4 x 4 squares. They form a 
    grid indicating possible positions for the placement of a display. Click on 
    one of the squares. This square is now displayed in the color and with the 
    number that you have previously enabled by the mouse click on one of the squares 
    in the upper row.</li>
  <li>To define the area which is to be covered by a display, click on additional 
    squares so that the squares form a coherent area. The area covered later by 
    a display in the Visualization view is determined by the squares with identical 
    color and number. It is also possible to generate a display which consists 
    of only one square. </li>
  <li>If your display has the desired size and position, click on another square 
    in the upper row of squares to define the size and position of another display. 
    All actions which you will from now on perform in the area underneath the 
    row of squares, will be executed with the color and number of the enabled 
    square. </li>
  <li>To close the layout editor and view the result of your arrangement, click 
    <b>OK</b>. If, on the other hand, you do not want to keep the changes of your 
    layout, click on <b>Cancel</b>. </li>
</ol>
<h3><b><a name="Examples"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  </b> Examples</h3>
<p>Taking the standard layout displayed above as a starting point, we will now 
  arrange the displays in such a way that they are no longer positioned side by 
  side but so that two displays are located in the upper and two in the lower 
  half of the Visualization view. For this purpose, the grid in the layout editor 
  must be such that 2 x 2 squares have the same color and number.</p>
<img src="pic/Layout2x2.gif" width="450" height="600" class="inP"> 
<p>This results in the following arrangement in the Visualization view:</p>
<img src="pic/Visu2x2.gif" width="421" height="314" class="inP"> 
<p>To arrange the two upper displays one under the other instead of side by side, 
  each display is arranged in a horizontal row of 4 squares: </p>
<img src="pic/Layouthr.gif" width="450" height="600" class="inP"> 
<p>The Visualization view now looks as follows:</p>
<img src="pic/Visuhr.gif" width="420" height="314" class="inP"> 
<p>For further examples of layouts, see the section <a href="Faceplatelayoutexample.htm">Examples 
  of Display Layouts</a>. </p>
<h3><b><a name="Rules"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a></b> 
  Rules for Creating valid Layouts</h3>
<p>Displays cannot be arranged at random in the layout editor. Therefore, you 
  have to observe a few rules to create a layout which can be displayed as a valid 
  layout in the Visualization view:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Squares with the same color and number have to be arranged in such a way 
    as to form a coherent area since a display cannot be distributed over several 
    places in the Visualization view which are not interconnected. </li>
  <li>Displays may not be L-shaped, i.e. squares with the same color and number 
    may not be arranged in L-shape.</li>
  <li>Displays may not be arranged in circular shape (see <a href="Faceplatelayoutexample.htm#rotate">Example 
    of a Circular Arrangement</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether the current arrangement of displays results in a valid layout, is indicated 
  in the layout editor by the text to the left of the two buttons <b>OK</b> and 
  <b>Cancel</b>. If the current arrangement of displays results in a valid layout, 
  the text reads <b> Faceplate Layout: Valid</b>. If, on the other hand, the current 
  arrangement does not result in a valid layout, the text <b>Faceplate Layout: 
  Invalid</b> is displayed. In this case, the <b>OK</b> button is disabled so 
  that an invalid layout cannot be accepted in the Visualization view.</p>
<p>For further examples of valid and invalid layouts, see the section <a href="Faceplatelayoutexample.htm">Examples 
  of Display Layouts</a>.</p>
<h2> <a name="OrderDisplay"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Editing Layouts via the Context Menu of the Displays </h2>
<p>Each display has a <b>Context</b> menu by means of which size and position 
  of the display can be influenced. With the <b>Expand</b> options, displays can 
  be expanded to the left or right; with the <b>Insert</b> options, other displays 
  can be inserted in the Visualization view. Changes which have been carried through 
  via the <b>Context</b> menu are inserted in the currently enabled layout and 
  displayed in the layout editor. <br>
  In addition, the <b>Context</b> menu contains two options for resetting the 
  displayed object and the options <b>Edit Layout</b> and <b>Copy Layout</b> (on 
  these options, see the sections <a href="#EditLayout">Editing a Layout in the 
  Layout Editor</a> and <a href="#SaveLayout">Saving Altered Layouts</a>). </p>
<p>The options in the <b>Context</b> menu are sensitive to context; i.e. only 
  those options are displayed which are relevant for the current position of a 
  display. If, for example, a display is already situated at the very left of 
  the Visualization view, this display cannot be further expanded to the left. 
  In this case, the option <b>Expand Left </b> does therefore not appear in the 
  <b>Context</b> menu of the corresponding display. As a rule, a display can only 
  be expanded in a direction where there are other displays as well. Similarly, 
  the <b>Insert</b> options for displays are only shown if the maximum number 
  of 4 displays in a vertical or horizontal row in the Visualization view has 
  not yet been reached.</p>
<p>A display inserted via the <b>Insert</b> options will generally be empty. If, 
  however, you have removed one or more displays from the Visualization view by 
  the <b>Expand</b> option before inserting a display (see the section <a href="#ExpandLeft">Expanding 
  a Display to the left</a>), the object which has been removed first and has 
  no longer been displayed until the time of insertion is loaded in the inserted 
  displays. </p>
<p>You can call the <b>Context</b> menu of a display by clicking with the right 
  mouse button in the title bar of the desired display. Please note that the display-specific 
  <b>Context</b> menu is only called if you click on the display title bar, whereas 
  a click in the display area of the display opens a <b>Context</b> menu which 
  contains options of the Internet Explorer.</p>

<h3><a name="ExpandLeft"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Expanding a Display to the left</h3>
<p>With the <b>Expand Left</b> option, you can expand a display in this direction. 
  The display which was located to the left of the selected display before this 
  option was enabled, is no longer displayed. Instead, the selected display is 
  expanded to cover the display area which was previously on its left. </p>
<p>If, for example, you expand the display with the function block instance <i>time_count</i>, 
  which is shown in the figure below, the display with the function block instance 
  <i>pulse</i> is replaced by the expanded area of the <i>time_count</i> display.

<h3><a name="ExpandRight"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Expanding a Display to the right</h3>
<p>With the <b>Expand Right</b> option, you can expand a display in this direction. 
  The representation of a display which has been expanded to the right is analogous 
  to <a href="#ExpandLeft">Expanding a Display to the left</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="ExpandUp"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Expanding a Display Upwards</h3>
<p>If there is a display located above another display, you can expand the lower 
  one upwards by the option <b>Expand Up</b>. The display which was located above 
  the selected display before this option was enabled, is no longer displayed. 
  Instead, the selected display is expanded to cover the display area which was 
  previously above it. </p>
<p>If, for example, you expand the display with the function block instance <i>time_count</i>, 
  which is shown in the figure below, the display with the function block instance 
  rise_edge2 is replaced by the expanded area of the time_count display. </p>
<img src="pic/InsertUp.gif" width="559" height="262" class="inP">

<h3><a name="ExpandDown"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Expanding a Display Downwards</h3>
<p>If there is a display located under another display, you can expand the upper 
  one downwards by the option <b>Expand Down</b>. The representation of a display 
  which has been expanded downwards is analogous to <a href="#ExpandUp">Expanding 
  a Display Upwards</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="InsertLeft"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Inserting a Display on the left Side</h3>
<p>With the <b>Insert Left</b> option, you can insert a display to the left of 
  another display you have selected. The selected display is reduced by the area 
  required by the display inserted on its left. </p>
<p>If, for example, you insert a display to the left of the display with the function 
  block instance <i>timer_base</i> in the figure below, the area of this display 
  is reduced by the space required by the newly inserted display. </p>

<h3><a name="InsertRight"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Inserting a Display on the right Side</h3>
<p>With the <b>Insert Right</b> option, you can insert a display to the right 
  of another display you have selected. The representation of a display inserted 
  on the right is analogous to <a href="#InsertLeft">Inserting a Display on the 
  left Side</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="InsertAbove"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Inserting a Display above a Selected Display</h3>
<p>With the <b>Insert Above</b> option, you can insert a display above of another 
  display you have selected. The selected display is reduced by the area required 
  by the display inserted above it. </p>
<p>If, for example, you insert a display above the display with the function block 
  instance <i>time_count</i> in the figure below, the area of this display is 
  reduced by the space required by the newly inserted display. </p>
<img src="pic/ExpandUp.gif" width="556" height="262" class="inP">

<h3><a name="InsertBelow"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Inserting a Display below a Selected Display</h3>
<p>With the <b>Insert Below</b> option, you can insert a display below another 
  display you have selected. The representation of a display inserted below is 
  analogous to <a href="#InsertAbove">Inserting a Display above a Selected Display</a>. 
</p>
<h3><a name="Clear"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Resetting the Display Content</h3>
<p>With the option <b>Clear</b> in the <b>Context</b> menu, you can reset the 
  display. The object previously represented in the selected display is no longer 
  displayed and the display title bar reads <i>Empty</i>. </p>
<p>With the option <b>Clear</b> <b>All</b>, the content of all displays in ATCM 
  Console is reset.</p>
<h2><a name="SaveLayout"></a><a href="#Overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Saving Altered Layouts</h2>
<p>Alterations carried through in a layout are not automatically saved and will 
  therefore be lost as soon as you close ATCM Console or update the entire Visualization 
  view. Therefore, you have to explicitly save a layout to maintain changes of 
  this layout permanently.</p>
<p>The arrangement of displays currently represented in the Visualization view 
  forms the basis for saving a layout. Both changes carried out via the layout 
  editor and changes carried through by means of the <b>Context</b> menu are saved. 
  If you have carried through changes in a layout and not yet saved them, the 
  entry <i>[Unsaved Layout]</i> is displayed in the <b>Layout</b> list box of 
  the ATCM Console toolbar.<br>
  During the saving of a layout, not only the current size and position of the 
  displays are stored but also the linkage to the objects which are currently 
  displayed. If you load a saved display, the objects assigned to the displays 
  are therefore also visualized in the displays as long as there still is a valid 
  linkage to the corresponding object. If the connection to the control on which 
  the object was loaded no longer exists or if the object has been removed from 
  the project, the message <i>The object &lt;object name&gt; has been removed 
  ! </i>appears on the displays assigned to the corresponding objects. </p>
<p>To save an altered layout, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>After editing a layout, click on the <b>Disk</b> button in the toolbar of 
    ATCM Engineering <br>
    <br>
    - OR -<br>
    <br>
    click with the right mouse button on the colored title bar of any desired 
    display to call the <b>Context</b> menu and in this menu, select the option 
    <b>Copy Layout</b>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Enter the name of the new layout in the lower input field of the dialog. 
    With the entry of the first character, the <b>Save as</b> button is enabled. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="pic/savefaceplate.gif" width="600" height="280"> <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Click on the <b>Save as</b> button to insert the layout in the <b>Available 
    Layouts</b> list. From now on, the layout is available for selection with 
    the new name in the list box of the ATCM Console toolbar. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Click on <b>Exit</b> to close the <b>Save Layout</b> dialog. The saved layout 
    automatically becomes the currently enabled layout. </li>
</ol>
<p>You can save several layouts by calling the <b>Save and Delete Layout</b> dialog 
  again after changing a layout and then entering a new name for the altered layout. 
  As before, the layout is inserted in the <b>Available Layouts</b> list.<br>
  After saving, the last saved layout automatically becomes the currently enabled 
  layout which is displayed in the <b>Layout</b> list box in the ATCM Console toolbar. 
</p>
<p>Saved layouts are managed inside ATCM Console and not stored as files. Therefore, 
  it is not possible to copy layouts on floppy disk to use them on a different 
  computer. </p>

  is displayed in the <b>Layout</b> list box in the ATCM Console toolbar.</p>
<p>To load a different layout,</p>
<ol>
  <li>click in the <b>Layout</b> list box on the button with the downward arrow 
    to scroll down the list of the list box. All stored layouts will be displayed
