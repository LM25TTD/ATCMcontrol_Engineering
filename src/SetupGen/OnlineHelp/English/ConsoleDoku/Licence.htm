  Registration of ATCMControl </H2>
<p>After installation, all installed ATCMControl components are running in <b>demo 
  mode</b>. This mode involves particular restrictions depending on the components 
  you have installed. For instance, you cannot access the I/O addresses of field 
  devices in demo mode. To use ATCMControl without restrictions, you need to register 
  the installed components. Registering is machine-dependent. This means that 
  the registration key created by ATCMControl for enabling the components is only 
  valid on the PC for which you have requested the registration key. There are 
  two ways to register your ATCMControl components: </p>
<p><b><a name="temporary"></a>Temporary registration:</b> <br>
  Select this registration type to test ATCMControl for a specific time without restrictions 
  of functionality. After a specific period of time, the registration key sent 
  to you by ATCMControl expires and ATCMControl runs in demo mode again.</p>
<p> <b><a name="Full"></a>Permanent registration:</b><br>
  If you have decided to use ATCMControl in your specific area of application in 
  the long term, select this registration type. The registered components can 
  be used without restrictions of functionality and without a time limit.</p>

  procedure.</a> </p>
<p><b><a name="machineindependent"></a>Machine-independent registering</b></p>
<p>Apart from a machine-dependent registering of ATCMControl components, you can 
  also obtain a <b>hard key</b> for machine-independent registering. The hard 
  key can be connected to the parallel port or USB port (only Windows 98 and Windows 
  2000). The ATCMControl components which you have installed in that PC and for which 
  the hard key has been registered are then enabled for unlimited use. With the 
  hard key, you can enable ATCMControl installations for unlimited use alternately 
  on different PCs. To order a hard key, you do not have to create an installation 
  key as described in the ATCMControl Registration section. Indicate the order number 
  and license number in your order and send it to <span class="text"><a href="mailto:support@4control.de">support@4control.de</a></span>.

    <br>
    To register your ATCMControl components, click <b>Create Installationkey </b>in 
    the Softing License Manager.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> In the next dialog box, enter the host name of the computer in which the 
    components to be registered have been installed and enter your company name. 
    These data are required for creating the installation key. In the <b>Machinename</b> 
    field, the host name of the computer on which you have started the Softing 
    License Manager is displayed by default; the <b>Company</b> field shows the 
    company name found in the Windows registry database. If you want to register 
    ATCMControl components which are installed in a different computer, you can overwrite 
    these fields. The permitted number of characters is limited to a total of 
    24 characters for both field. <br>

    to ATCMControl to have the final registration key generated for you. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>To do this, click <b>Copy Installationkey to Clipboard</b> to copy the installation 
    key to the Windows clipboard. You can now paste the installation key from

  <li> Send the installation key <b>together with the order number and license 
    number</b> to <a href="mailto:support@4control.de">support@4control.de</a>.

    final registration key as soon as possible.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> You will receive the final registration key by Email as soon as possible. 
    When you have received the final registration key, open the Softing License 
    Manager again and enter the key in the <b>Enter Registration Key(s) </b>field. 
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
