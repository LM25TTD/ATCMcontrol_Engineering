<p>In general, you can use all of the possibilities for debugging SFC program 
  sections that are available for debugging projects which do not contain SFC 
  program sections. Furthermore, ATCMControl also offers a special SFC watch mode 
  for SFC program sections and options with which you can influence and control 
  specific actions and transitions in the debug mode or during the normal runtime 
  of the project on ATCM Control. </p>
<p>Independent of whether the normal runtime mode or the debug mode is active, 
  the keyword <i>STEP</i> of the currently active steps and the keyword <i>ACTION</i> 
  of the currently executed actions are highlighted in gray within the SFC program 
  sections in the ST editor of the editor's Instance view. This shows you straight 
  away which steps and which actions are currently being executed. </p>
<img src="pic/markStep.gif" width="417" height="246" class="inP"> 
<p>At the same time, the graphical representation of the active step and the upper 
  part of the graphical representation of a currently active action are highlighted 
  in gray in the graphic editor. If the statements associated with an action were 
  defined in an action block, the fields for the qualifier and name of the action 
  block are highlighted in gray. </p>

  SFC Watch Mode</h2>
<p>SFC program sections feature a watch mode which allows you to control switching 
  from one step to the successor step within SFC program sections. During normal 
  runtime, a cycle of the SFC program section is executed every time a POU (program 
  or function block) calls an instance of an SFC program section. During this 
  cycle, all statements within actions that are assigned to a step currently active 
  during the execution of the cycle are executed exactly once (provided the actions 
  are called with the qualifier <i>N</i>). If you add the value 1 to a variable 
  within an action, for example, the variable value will be incremented by the 
  value 1 during every cycle that is executed by an SFC program section, provided 
  that a step assigned to the action is active.<br>
  Basically, this also applies for the SFC watch mode, except that the transition 
  conditions are not evaluated. A step thus does not switch to the successor step 
  even if the corresponding transition condition is <i>TRUE</i>. Transactions 
  are only evaluated in the SFC watch mode if you explicitly command to do so 
  by a keystroke or menu option. In this case, the transaction evaluation is executed 
  for exactly one SFC cycle. After that, the transition condition is suspended 
  again until you initiate the next single step. You can thus use this procedure 
  to execute SFC program sections step by step and determine by yourself when 
  a transition to the next step is to be performed. </p>
<p>When working in the SFC watch mode, please note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transitions are not forced if you activate a single SFC step. A single SFC 
    step only serves to re-enable the transition evaluation for the duration of 
    an SFC cycle. Only if the transition condition for activating the successor 
    step is actually met, the successor step is activated and the predecessor 
    step deactivated. The evaluation will only be performed for the transition 
    whose predecessor step is currently active. </li>
  <li>Since it is only the evaluation of the transition that is suspended in the 
    SFC watch mode, the action assigned to the currently active step will continue 
    to be executed.</li>
  <li>In the SFC watch mode, the execution of all non-SFC program sections and 
    of all SFC program sections for which the watch mode has not been activated 
    is also continued at the normal task cycle of the assigned task. The SFC watch 
    mode thus applies exclusively for the SFC program section for which you have 
    activated the SFC watch mode. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>To activate the SFC watch mode, proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that the window of an SFC program section is displayed in the foreground 
    of ATCM Engineering and that the Instance view of the window that is currently 
    in the foreground is activated. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>With the right mouse button, click into the window to open the <b>Context</b> 
    menu and select the option <b>SFC Manual Mode</b><br>
    <br>
    <i>- OR -</i><br>
    <br>
    click the menu <b>Debug</b> in the menu bar of the ATCM Engineering main window 
    and select the option <b>SFC Manual Mode</b>.<br>
    The check that is now displayed next to the option <b>SFC Manual Mode</b> 
    shows you that the SFC watch mode has been activated. </li>
</ul>

  Menu Options for Controlling Actions and Transitions </h2>
<p>The execution of actions and transitions can be controlled with the help of 
  special menu options, independent of whether the SFC watch mode is active or 
  whether an SFC program section is currently in normal runtime mode. You can, 
  for example, force the execution of actions even if the associated step is not 
  active or prevent the execution of transitions even if their transition conditions 
  are met and the predecessor step is active. </p>
<p>You find the options for forcing or preventing the execution of actions and 
  transitions in the <b>Debug</b> menu of the toolbar of the ATCM Engineering main 
  window and in the <b>Context</b> menu of the editor that is currently in the 
  foreground. They are located in the bottom section of the <b>Context</b> menu.</p>
<p> The options are context-sensitive which means that they are only available 
  when your current work window in the foreground of ATCM Engineering contains the 
  code of a POU with an SFC program section. Which action- and transition-specific 
  menu options are available also depends on the cursor position within the ST 
  or FBD editor window. <br>
  These menu options can generally be divided into options that refer to all actions 
  and transitions that exist in the current SFC program section and options that 
  are only effective for a single action or transition. </p>
<p>If you place the cursor on a line of the ST editor that does not contain the 
  keywords <i>ACTION</i> or <i>TRANSITION</i>, the menu only offers options that 
  refer to all actions and transitions.</p>
<img src="pic/STAllOptions.gif" width="495" height="476" class="inP"> 
<p>In the FBD editor, the menu options that refer to all transitions and actions 
  are displayed when you place the cursor in a free area within the graphic editor. 
</p>
<p>In addition to the menu options that refer to all transitions and actions, 
  options are available which refer to a specific transition or action when you 
  place the cursor on a line of the ST editor which contains either the keyword 
  <i>TRANSITION</i> or the keyword <i>ACTION</i>. In this case, all the options 
  that are not of a general nature always refer to the transition or action which 
  is located in the line on which the cursor is placed. The non-general menu options 
  offered depend on whether a transition or an action is initiated in the line 
  on which the cursor is currently positioned. In the first case, special options 
  are only offered for transitions, in the latter case, they are only offered 
  for actions. </p>
<img src="pic/STSpecificOptions.gif" width="494" height="477" class="inP"> 
<p><a name="so"></a>In the FBD editor, options that refer to a single transition 
  or action are only displayed when you place the cursor on the heading area of

  Forcing and Blocking the Execution of Actions</h2>
<p>You can force the execution of one or several actions even if the steps assigned 
  to these actions are currently not active and the actions would therefore not 
  be executed in the normal sequence of the program evolution.<br>
  You can also prevent an action from being executed even if the step assigned 
  to an action is currently active and would therefore be executed in the normal 
  sequence of the program evolution. </p>
<p class="zusammenhalten">The following options are available for controlling 
  actions: </p>
<p class="nachoben">Options that refer to a single action:</p>

<h3><a name="ForceActionOnce"></a><a href="#overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Forcing the one-time execution of an action</h3>
<p> If you force the one-time execution of an action, this action is executed 
  exactly once during an SFC cycle with all statements it contains, independent 
  of whether the step assigned to it is active. </p>
<p>To force an action to be executed once, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that the window of an SFC program section is displayed in the foreground 
    of ATCM Engineering and that the Instance view of the window that is currently 
    in the foreground is activated. </li>
  <li>In the ST editor, place the cursor on the line containing the keyword <i>ACTION</i> 
    of the action whose execution you want to force. <br>
    In the graphic editor, place the cursor on the heading area of the graphical 
    representation of the desired action or action block.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Context</b> menu or <b>Debug</b> menu, click the option <b> Force 
    Action Once</b>. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>An action whose execution you have forced is identified in the ST editor by 
  displaying the keyword <i>ACTION</i> in green, together with a datatip indicating 
  <i>forced</i>.</p>
<img src="pic/ActionForced.gif" width="384" height="296" class="inP"> 
<p>In the graphic editor, an action whose execution was forced is represented

    <tr> 
      <td class="HinweisText"> You usually only see the visual representation 
        of an action whose execution was forced once if the task cycle of the 
        calling task was set to a very high value since the time required for 
        visualization is in most cases higher than the set task cycle. This also 
        applies when the SFC watch mode is active since the SFC program section 
        in this case is also called at the regular task cycle and executes actions 
        according to the task cycle. </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>An action that was forced once automatically reverts to its original state 
    if an SFC cycle was executed after the action was forced. If the action, for 
    example, had been blocked in the step before a one-time execution was forced, 
    this step is reactivated after an SFC cycle was executed once. </p>
</div>
<h3><a name="ForceActionPermanent"></a><a href="#overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Forcing the permanent execution of an action</h3>
<p>If you force the permanent execution of an action, this action is executed 
  permanently with all the statements it contains in every cycle of an SFC program 
  section, independent of whether the step assigned to it is active. Note that 
  the permanently forced execution of an action has no effect on the transition 
  conditions and activity of steps. The execution of all actions assigned to an 
  active step during the cycle time of an SFC program section is thus continued 
  besides the permanent action. </p>
<p>To force an action to be executed permanently, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that the window of an SFC program section is displayed in the foreground 
    of ATCM Engineering and that the Instance view of the window that is currently 
    in the foreground is activated. </li>

  Blocking the execution of an action permanently</h3>
<p>If you block the execution of an action, this action is permanently not executed 
  even if a step assigned to the action is active. Blocking the action only affects 
  the action itself, not the steps assigned to the action or the conditions of 
  transitions. The steps assigned to the action thus continue to be executed according 
  to the regular program evolution; only the execution of the actions assigned 
  to a step are inhibited. </p>
<p>To block the execution of an action, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that the window of an SFC program section is displayed in the foreground 
    of ATCM Engineering and that the Instance view of the window that is currently 
    in the foreground is activated. </li>
  <li>In the ST editor, place the cursor on the keyword <i>ACTION</i> of the action 
    whose execution you want to block. <br>

  Blocking the execution of all actions permanently</h3>
<p>If you block the execution of all actions, none of the actions contained in 
  the current SFC program section will be executed. Blocking all actions has no 
  effect on the normal program evolution unless you set the transition conditions 
  within the actions; this means that all steps continue to be run depending on 
  the transition conditions, however, without executing the assigned actions.</p>
<p>To block the execution of all actions, proceed as follows:</p>

  <li>Ensure that the window of an SFC program section is displayed in the foreground 
    of ATCM Engineering and that the Instance view of the window that is currently 
    in the foreground is activated. </li>

  Forcing and Blocking the Execution of Transitions</h2>
<p>You can force the execution of transitions even if the corresponding transition 
  conditions are not met. <br>
  You can also block the execution of transitions even if the corresponding transition 
  conditions are met. </p>
<p>The following options are available for controlling transitions:</p>
<p>Options that refer to a single transition:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="#ForceTransitionOnce">Forcing a transition once</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ForceTransPermanently">Forcing a transition permanently</a></li>
  <li><a href="#SuppressTrans">Blocking a transition permanently</a></li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="ForceTransitionOnce"></a><a href="#overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Forcing a transition once</h3>
<p>Forcing transitions is especially suitable for ensuring in the case of alternative 
  sequences that the sequence selection leads to a specific step independent of 
  the current transitions conditions. <br>
  Apart from that you can use the forcing of a transition condition to cause the 
  activation of a successor step without the transition condition, which would 
  be required for this purpose in the normal program evolution, needing to be 
  met. The step following the transition in this case becomes active after the 
  transition was forced, independent of the transition condition. </p>
<p>The status of a forced transition reverts automatically when the program evolution 
  has reached the transition and the step following the transition has been activated. 
  After that, the transition is again subject to the transition condition set 
  in the normal program evolution. </p>
<p>To force a transition once, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that a window of an SFC program section is displayed in the foreground 
    of ATCM Engineering and that the Instance view of the window that is currently 
    in the foreground is activated. </li>
  <li>In the ST editor, place the cursor on the line containing the keyword <i>TRANSITION</i> 
    of the transition whose execution you want to force. <br>
    In the graphic editor, place the cursor on the graphical representation of 
    the desired transition. </li>
  <li>In the <b>Context</b> menu or <b>Debug</b> menu, click the option <b> Force 
    Transition Once</b>. <br>

  Forcing a transition permanently</h3>
<p>If you force a transition permanently, this transition is executed whenever 
  a step preceding the transition is active, independent of the assigned transition 
  condition. In the case of alternative sequences, for example, you can use this 
  method to force a specific sequence selection to always be executed independent 
  of the transition conditions of the transitions activated in the sequence selection. 
</p>
<p>To force a transition permanently, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that a window of an SFC program section is displayed in the foreground 
    of ATCM Engineering and that the Instance view of the window that is currently 
    in the foreground is activated. </li>
  <li>In the ST editor, place the cursor on the line containing the keyword <i>TRANSITION</i> 
    of the transition whose execution you want to force. <br>
    In the graphic editor, place the cursor on the graphical representation of 
    the desired transition. </li>
  <li>In the <b>Context</b> menu or <b>Debug</b> menu, click the option <b> Force 
    Transition Permanently</b>. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The transition is executed permanently until you click the option <b>Force 
  Transition Permanently</b> once again so that the check that was inserted in 
  front of the option in the menu when you selected this option disappears again. 
</p>
<p>In the ST editor, a transition whose execution you have forced permanently 
  is identified by displaying the keyword <i>TRANSITION</i> in green, together

  Blocking a transition permanently</h3>
<p>If you block a transition permanently, this transition will never be executed. 
  In alternative sequences, for example, you can prevent a specific step from 
  being activated by blocking the transition that precedes this step. <br>
  Note that you can inhibit the normal program evolution of an SFC program section 
  completely if you block a transition within a linear sequence structure. If 
  the path from one step to the next leads exclusively over the blocked transition, 
  for example, none of the subsequent steps can become active. The program evolution 
  in this case stops.</p>
<p>To block a transition permanently, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that the window of an SFC program section is displayed in the foreground 
    of ATCM Engineering and that the Instance view of the window that is currently 
    in the foreground is activated. </li>
  <li>In the ST editor, place the cursor on the line containing the keyword <i>TRANSITION</i> 
    of the transition you want to block. <br>
    In the graphic editor, place the cursor on the graphical representation of 
    the desired transition. </li>
  <li>In the <b>Context</b> menu or <b>Debug</b> menu, click the option <b> Block 
    Transition Permanently</b>. </li>

<p>A transition whose execution you have blocked permanently is identified in 
  the editor by displaying the keyword <i>TRANSITION</i> in red, together with 
  a datatip indicating <i>blocked</i>. </p>

  Forcing all transitions permanently</h3>
<p>If you force all transitions permanently, all transitions of the current SFC 
  program section will be enabled permanently, independent of the transition conditions. 
</p>
<p>To force all transitions permanently, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that a window of an SFC program section is displayed in the foreground 
    of ATCM Engineering and that the Instance view of the window that is currently 
    in the foreground is activated. </li>

  <li>In the <b>Context</b> menu or <b>Debug</b> menu, click the option <b> Force 
    All Transitions</b>. </li>

  Blocking all transitions permanently</h3>
<p>If you block all transitions permanently, no transition will be executed in 
  the current SFC program section. The program evolution is suspended in the currently 
  active step.</p>
<p>To block all transitions permanently, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that a window of an SFC program section is displayed in the foreground 
    of ATCM Engineering and that the Instance view of the window that is currently 
    in the foreground is activated. </li>

  Reverting all transitions to their original states</h3>
<p>Independent of whether the execution of individual transitions or all transitions 
  of an SFC program section was forced or blocked, this option causes all transitions 
  to revert to their original states, which means that the forcing or blocking 
  of all transitions is canceled, and the SFC program section is executed again 
  according to the normal program evolution. </p>
<p>To have all transitions revert to their original states, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that a window of an SFC program section is displayed in the foreground 
    of ATCM Engineering and that the Instance view of the window that is currently 
    in the foreground is activated. </li>
  <li>Place the cursor on any desired position in the ST editor and graphic editor.<br>
  </li>
  <li>In the <b>Context</b> menu or <b>Debug</b> menu, click the option <b>Revert 
    All Transitions</b>. </li>
</ol>
<p>The datatips of forced or blocked transitions are no longer displayed, elements 
  of transitions that were highlighted in color change back to their original 
  color.</p>
