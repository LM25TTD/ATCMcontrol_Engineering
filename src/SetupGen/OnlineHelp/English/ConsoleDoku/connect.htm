  Connecting Possibilities / Starting ATCM Console</h2>
<p>In ATCM Engineering, a configuration cannot only be assigned to the local computer 
  but also to a remote computer. In ATCMControl, configuration and PC are practically 
  identical after a configuration has been assigned to a PC. For execution, a 
  configuration is loaded in the control of the computer to which the corresponding 
  configuration was assigned. In this way, it is possible, for example, to compile 
  a project in ATCM Engineering on the local computer and execute it on a remote 
  computer by loading it in the control located in the remote computer. If you 
  have a license for multiple configurations, you can also create several configurations 
  in one project each of which is assigned to a different PC and therefore executed 
  in the control of the corresponding PC. </p>
<p>In a started instance of ATCM Console, the process data of a specific configuration 
  are visually displayed. For this purpose, ATCM Console establishes a connection, 
  via the OPC interface, to the control of the computer assigned to the configuration. 
  From the local computer, the configuration executed in the control of the local 
  computer can be visually displayed and monitored in ATCM Console as well as a 
  configuration which runs on a remote computer. It is also possible to monitor 
  in ATCM Console, from several remote computers, the same configuration loaded 
  on a ATCM Control. </p>
<p>The configuration to be displayed and the corresponding control are already 
  selected when ATCM Console is started, i.e. the context from which ATCM Console 
  was started determines which control the displayed data come from. There are 
  three possibilities for starting ATCM Console:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#byTray">Starting via the ATCM Tray in the Windows Program Menu</a></li>
  <li><a href="#byEngineering">Starting from ATCM Engineering</a></li>
  <li><a href="#byExplorer">Starting by Entering the Starting Address in the Address 
    Field of the Internet Explorer </a></li>
</ul>
<p> If there are several configurations in one single project, the configuration 
  can still be changed after ATCM Console has been started.</p>
<p>If ATCM Console is started via the ATCM Tray or by entry of a starting address 
  in the address field of the Internet Explorer, all objects contained in the 
  project can be loaded in a <a href="Faceplate.htm">Display</a> via 
  the <a href="Interface.htm#NaviView">Navigator of ATCM Console</a> and be displayed 
  there. The arrangement of the displays assigned to these objects can be changed 
  via the <b>Context</b> menu or the Layout Editor (see section <a href="Layout.htm#Layout">Working 
  with Layouts</a>). If, on the other hand, ATCM Console is started from ATCM Engineering, 
  the selection of objects which can be loaded in a display depends on the calling 
  position for ATCM Console (see <a href="#byEngineering">Starting ATCM Console from 
  ATCM Engineering</a>). </p>

  Starting ATCM Console via the ATCM Tray </h3>
<p>If ATCM Console is started via the ATCM Tray, it is opened as a standalone application 
  within the Internet Explorer. In a ATCM Console started via the ATCM Tray, the visualized 
  process data always belong to the control on the local computer. </p>
<p>To start ATCM Console via the ATCM Tray,</p>
<p>double-click with the left mouse button on the ATCMControl icon on the right or 
  bottom end of the Windows task menu <img src="pic/IcControlgreen.gif" width="16" height="16"><br>
  <br>
  - OR -<br>
  <br>
  click with the right mouse button on the ATCMControl icon <img src="pic/IcControlgreen.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
  to open its <b>Context</b> menu and select <b>Open ATCM Console</b>.</p>
<h3><a name="byEngineering"></a><a href="#overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Starting ATCM Console from ATCM Engineering</h3>
<p>If ATCM Console is started from ATCM Engineering, it is opened as a window within 
  ATCM Engineering, i.e. the ATCM Console window can only be displaced within ATCM Engineering. 
  From ATCM Engineering, several instances of ATCM Console can be called. Each instance 
  is displayed in a separate window within ATCM Engineering.</p>
<p>Except for the <b>Context</b> menu, a Console window started from ATCM Engineering 
  contains only the ATCM Control-specific operation and visualization elements. 
  Part of the Internet Explorer functionality is replaced by a group of buttons 
  with the most important navigation functions. For details on this group of buttons, 
  see the section <a href="Interface.htm#IEPanel">Internet Navigation Menu 
  in ATCM Engineering</a>. </p>
<p>From ATCM Engineering, ATCM Console is started via the <b>Context</b> menu of the 
  ATCM Engineering navigator.<br>
  The <b>Context</b> menu of the Engineering Navigator with a menu item for opening 
  ATCM Console can be called from the following positions:</p>
<dl> 
  <dt><b>in the Hardware view </b></dt>
  <dd>from a PC icon <img src="pic/PCSymb.gif" width="22" height="18" align="top"></dd>
  <dt><b>in the Instance view </b></dt>
  <dd>from the icon of a configuration <img src="pic/ConfigSymb.gif" width="23" height="19" align="top">,<br>
    a resource <img src="pic/ResourceSymb.gif" width="24" height="19" align="top"><br>
    or a task<img src="pic/TaskSymb.gif" width="24" height="17" align="top">.</dd>
</dl>
<p>After selecting one of these icons, click on the right mouse button to call 
  the <b>Context</b> menu and in this menu, select the option <b>Open ATCM Console</b>.</p>
<p><a name="StartPosition"></a>The control with which ATCM Console is connected 
  when started from ATCM Engineering, and the visualized object of the configuration 
  depend on the calling position which was selected for opening the <b>Context</b> 
  menu. </p>
<p>If only one configuration has been generated in the project currently opened 
  in ATCM Engineering, the visualized process data are always the ones loaded on 
  the control which is located on the PC assigned to the configuration. This can 
  be either the local PC or a remote computer. All objects in the configuration 
  are available for selection in the Navigator of ATCM Console if the calling position 
  for the <b>Context</b> menu is either the PC icon or the configuration icon. 
  If the <b>Context</b> menu is called from the position of a resource icon, the 
  <a href="faceplate.htm#TaskList">task list</a> of the configuration is displayed; 
  if it is called from the position of a task icon, the <a href="faceplate.htm#TasksFP">faceplate 
  of the previously selected task </a>is displayed (for more information on the 
  Navigator and the faceplates in ATCM Console, see the sections <a href="Interface.htm">User 
  Interface</a> and <a href="faceplate.htm">Displays</a>). If called from the 
  last two positions, the Navigator is not shown; as a result of this the selection 
  of objects is restricted. </p>
<p>If you have a license for multiple configurations, you can also create several 
  configurations in one project. In this case, ATCM Console is connected to the 
  control on the PC whose assigned configuration (or an icon under this configuration) 
  has been selected as calling position for the <b>Context</b> menu. If started 
  from the calling position which is shown in the following figure, ATCM Console 
  is connected to the control assigned to <i>Configuration2</i>, as an example.

  Starting ATCM Console by Entering the Starting Address in the Internet Explorer</h3>
<p>If ATCM Console is started from the Internet Explorer, the PC to whose control 
  ATCM Console is to be connected can be indicated together with the starting address:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start the Internet Explorer.</li>
  <li>Enter the desired starting page in the <b>address</b> box. The address must 
    have the following syntax:<br>
    '<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">http//&lt;PC name&gt;/4C</font>'. 
    If your PC is called, for instance, <i>Automation1</i>, the address is '<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">http//Automation1/4C</font>'.</li>
  <li>Click on <b>Change to </b>or press the <b>Enter</b> key to call the entered 
    address.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="Password"></a><a href="#overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Password Protection</h2>
<p>In ATCM Engineering, a password for the currently loaded project can be entered 
  (see also the section &quot;Project-specific password&quot;). This password 
  becomes effective after compilation of the project. If a configuration contained 
  in a password-protected project is loaded on a ATCM Control, a password inquiry 
  is carried through when ATCM Console is started. For password-protected projects, 
  a password must be entered independently of whether the control to be connected 
  is on a local or a remote computer. However, the inquiry is only carried through 
  if ATCM Console is started outside of ATCM Engineering, i.e. via the ATCM Tray or 
  the address field of the Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>The security check differentiates between two access levels:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Read only access:</b> The console can be started and the process variables 
    monitored. The restriction of the read only access is that values of process 
    variables cannot be changed. Tasks and resources cannot be started or stopped, 
    either. </li>
  <li><b>Unlimited access:</b> Values of process variables can be read and changed 
    if there is write access to the respective variable from the assigned display. 
    Tasks and resources can be started and stopped. </li>
</ul>
<p>Which access level is valid for a configuration is determined when the password 
  is assigned in ATCM Engineering (in the <b>Tools - Project Settings... </b> menu, 
  <b>Console</b> tab).</p>
<p>Please note that a password inquiry also takes place if, for example, you update 
  the entire Visualization view of ATCM Console after a download via the <b>Update</b> 
  button in the toolbar of the Internet Explorer or if you update a specific display 
  via the Explorer <b>Context</b> menu of the display. If the latter is the case, 
  the password dialog is only displayed in the updated display. </p>
<h4><a name="login"></a>Logging in with ATCM Console<br>
  <br>
</h4>
<img src="pic/LoginScreen2.gif" width="447" height="405" class="inP"> 
<p>To log in with ATCM Console in case of a password protection, write the password 
  in the input field and confirm with <b>Enter</b>.<br>
  If you have misspelled the password, you can clear the input field by clicking 
  on <b>Reset</b> and repeat the entry. </p>
<p>If you enter an invalid password, access to the console is denied and the Login 
  dialog box is restarted.<br>
  If, on the other hand, you enter a valid password, a console session is started 
  with all access rights which are made available by the entered password. </p>
<h2><a name="end"></a><a href="#overview"><img src="pic/Jump.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
  Interrupting a Connection to ATCM Control</h2>
<p> An existing connection is interrupted if one of the following events occurs: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Logout</b> button of the console is pressed. </li>
  <li>A new project is loaded on the control connected to ATCM Console.</li>
  <li> The connection is interrupted, for instance, by closing of the Internet 
    Explorer, and not restarted within approx. 30 seconds. In this case, the data 
    of the current connection, which have been stored on the server, are lost. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>Logout</b> button is located in the toolbar of ATCM Console. It is only 
  displayed if the loaded configuration is protected by a password. If the currently 
  loaded configuration has no password, this button is not visible. <br>
  With a click on the <b>Logout</b> button, the existing connection is interrupted 
  and the Login dialog redisplayed. <br>
  If, after logging out, you log back in with the same password, you will reestablish 
  a connection to the control to which you were connected before. </p>
