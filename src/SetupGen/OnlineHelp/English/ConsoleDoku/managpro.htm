  <h2><a name="Convert"></a><a href="#overview"><img src="pic/jump.gif" border=0 ></a> 
    Convert Projects Created with an Earlier ATCMControl Version </h2>
  <p>Due to the numerous changes and new features in the current ATCMControl version, 
    it has been necessary to substantially rearrange the design of the ATCMControl 
    project file '*.4cp'. Projects which were created with one of the ATCMControl 
    predecessor versions can therefore no longer be loaded with the current version. 
    Naturally, though, it has been ensured that you can continue to work with 
    your old projects without having to carry through any changes in the project 
    yourself. Together with the new ATCMControl version, the conversion file <i>4Convert.exe</i> 
    responsible for the convenient conversion of older projects has been installed 
    in the 'Eng' directory directly underneath your ATCMControl directory. This file 
    is automatically called if you try to load a project created with a predecessor 
    version of V1.2.</p>
  <p>Therefore, you can directly convert a project in ATCM Engineering that was 
    created with an earlier version than V1.2:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start ATCM Engineering and call the dialog box for opening a project with 
      the <b>Open Project</b> option.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>In this dialog box, select the desired project file. You can recognize 
      a project file by the file ending '.4cp'.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="pic/OpenProject.jpg" width="426" height="264"><br>
      <br>
      Click on the <b>Open</b> button. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>A message box is displayed which informs you that you are trying to load 
      a project created with an earlier ATCMControl version and which asks you whether 
      you want to convert the project to the new format. <br>
      <br>
      <img src="pic/Convert.gif" width="384" height="139"> <br>
      <br>
      Confirm this message with <b>Yes</b>. Your project is now converted to the 
      new format.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> Messages about the conversion progress are displayed in a DOS box.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="pic/DosConvert.gif" width="652" height="331"> <br>
      <br>
      During the conversion, a backup directory is created which contains your 
      old project in the unchanged format. The backup directory is part of the 
      same higher-level directory as your original project directory. The name 
      of the backup directory is made up of the name of your old project directory 
      with the ending <i>BACKUP</i>, separated from the name by an underline character, 
      and the date and time when the directory was created. If the directory with 
      your old project file was called <i>Pump</i>, for instance, the backup directory 
      might be called <i>Pump_BACKUP_Wed_Jul_21_16-38-39_1999</i>. The new project, 
      on the other hand, is in the directory where your old project was before 
      the conversion, i.e. in our example in the <i>Pump</i> directory. You can 
      also see the name of the backup directory in the first line of the DOS box.<br>
      After the message <i>conversion completed successfully</i> has been displayed 
      in the DOS box, press the <b>Enter</b> key to close the box and finish the 
      conversion process.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Open the converted project which is now located in the directory of the 
      original project in order to load it in ATCM Engineering and make sure that 
      it has been converted correctly. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Instead of converting an old project in ATCM Engineering, you can also call 
    <i>4Convert.exe</i> in the DOS box or in the Windows instruction menu.</p>
  <p>This is how you can call <i>4Convert.exe</i> in the DOS box:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on <b>Input Request</b> in the Windows <b>Start</b> menu <img src="pic/Dosprompt.gif" width="19" height="20" align="absbottom">.</li>
    <li>Go to the Eng directory in your ATCMControl directory.</li>
    <li>For parameters, <i>4Convert.exe </i> needs the path and the file name 
      of the project to be converted. Therefore, enter <i>4Convert</i> and then 
      the path and 4cp file of your project, e.g.<i> 4Convert C:\Programs\4Control\Projects\pump.4cp</i>.</li>
    <li>Confirm your input by pressing the <b>Enter</b> key. As has been described 
      in point 4, your project is now converted to the new format and a backup 
      directory with your original project is created. </li>
    <li>After the message <i>conversion completed successfully</i> has been displayed 
      in the DOS box, press the <b>Enter</b> key to close the box and finish the 
      conversion process.<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>If you want to call <i>4Convert.exe</i> via the instruction menu, proceed 
    as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on <b>Execute...</b> in the Windows <b>Start</b> menu . <img src="pic/Execute.gif" width="33" height="26" align="absbottom">.</li>
    <li>Enter the complete path of <i>4Convert.exe</i> and, separated by an empty 
      space, the complete path of the project file to be converted.</li>
    <li>Confirm your input with <b>OK</b>. The DOS box is opened and messages 
      on the conversion progress are issued. During conversion, a backup directory 
      with your old project is created. </li>
    <li>After the message <i>conversion completed successfully</i> has been displayed 
      in the DOS box, press the <b>Enter</b> key to close the box and finish the 
      conversion process.<br>
    </li>

      concluded by a semicolon after the variable declaration) and the <i>END_PROGRAM</i>

<h4> <a name="breakpoint"></a>Set/remove breakpoint</h4>
<p class="nachoben"> Breakpoints can be set for program instances and function 
  blocks. <br>
  To set a breakpoint,</p>
<p> position the cursor in the source code editor in the place where you want 
  to set the breakpoint and click on <strong>Set/Remove Breakpoint</strong> in 
  the <strong>Context</strong> menu </p>
<p><i>- OR -</i></p>
<p>position the cursor in the source code editor in the place where you want to 
  set the breakpoint and press the <strong>F9</strong> key. </p>
<img src="pic/setbp.gif" height=431 width=510 class="inP"> 
<p>The breakpoint is set in the editor in the nearest possible place to the current 
  cursor position. You can recognize a set breakpoint by the red circle in the 
  editor frame. </p>
<img src="pic/bpaktiv.gif" height=431 width=510 class="inP"> 
<p>To remove a breakpoint,</p>
<p>position the cursor in the editor near the breakpoint that you want to remove 
  and click on <strong>Set/Remove Breakpoint</strong> in the <b>Context</b> menu 
</p>
<p><i>- OR -</i></p>
<p>place the cursor in the editor near the breakpoint that you want to remove 
  and press the <strong>F9</strong> key. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To remove all breakpoints,</p>
<p>click on <strong>Remove All Breakpoints</strong> in the <strong>Context</strong> 
  menu</p>
<p> <i>- OR -</i> </p>
<p>press the key combination <strong>Ctrl-Shift-F9</strong>. </p>
<h4>Working with breakpoints</h4>
<p class="nachoben">Breakpoints are represented in the editors by the following 
  icons: </p>
<p><img src="pic/bp2.gif" height=12 width=11> enabled breakpoint before the program 
  execution is stopped at this position<br>
  <img src="pic/bp1.gif" height=12 width=12> enabled breakpoint at which the program 
  execution was stopped <br>
  <img src="pic/bp3.gif" height=12 width=11> disabled breakpoint ignored during 
  debugging </p>
<p>To enable or disable a breakpoint, click on <strong>Enable/Disable Breakpoint</strong> 
  in the <strong>Context</strong> menu</p>
<p> <i>- OR -</i> </p>
<p> press the key combination <strong>Ctrl-F9</strong>. 
<p> After the breakpoint is reached, the running task changes to the <i>Break 
  status</i>. There are two possibilities to continue program execution: </p>
<p>Continue program execution to the next breakpoint. For this purpose, click 
  in the <strong>Context</strong> menu on <strong>Continue</strong> or press the 
  <strong>F5</strong> key. </p>
<p>Execute the program up to the next place where a breakpoint is permitted (this 
  place depends on whether advanced or simple debugging has been set). For this 
  purpose, click in the <strong>Context</strong> menu on <strong>Single Step</strong> 
  or press the <strong>F10</strong> key. </p>
