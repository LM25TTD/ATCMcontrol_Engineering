<h3><a name="Navigation"></a>Navigating in the Help Topics</h3>
<p>All help topics provided in this on-line help are listed in a tree structure on the <b>Contents</b> tab which is displayed to the left of this help page. To select a help topic and show the associated help text, click the desired topic on this tab with the left mouse button. </p>
<p>Help chapters that contain subchapters are represented by a book icon. By double-clicking the book icon <img src="bookclosed.gif" width="17" height="15"> or by clicking the <b>plus</b> sign in front of the book icon, you can expand the associated branch and display the subchapters available in this chapter. If the subchapters are displayed already, a <b>minus</b> sign appears instead of the plus sign in front of the chapter and the book icon changes to an open book <img src="bookopened.gif" width="15" height="15">. 

 A help chapter that does not contain any further subchapters is represented as a page with a blue question mark <img src="page.gif" width="12" height="15">.</p>
<p>Not all book icons of the tree structure are assigned help pages. 

 These icons are only provided to show how the help files are organized and thus do not display a help text when clicked with the mouse. </p>
<p>To scroll through the help topics you displayed before, you can use the <b>Back</b> and <b>Forward</b> buttons that are provided on the toolbar of the on-line help.</p>
<table >

   <td valign="top"><img src="icback.gif" width="69" height="40"></td>

   <td valign="top"> 

     <p style="margin-left: 5px">Click the <b>Back</b> button to scroll backwards through the help topics you have already looked at.</p>

     <p style="margin-left: 5px">If you have already scrolled backwards to one or more previously opened help topics, you can click the <b>Forward</b> button to move to the help topics from which you started scrolling backwards. When you click the <b>Forward</b> button, the topics are displayed in exactly the opposite order in which they appeared when you clicked <b>Back</b>. </p>

<h3><a name="Search"></a>Finding a Term in the Help</h3>
<p>If you want to find a specific term in the on-line help, you can use the <b>Index</b> and <b>Search</b> tabs in the navigation bar to the left of the main window. </p>
<p>The <b>Index</b> tab contains keywords which are listed alphabetically. These keywords correspond to the most important topics that are dealt with in the on-line help. Some keywords represent the generic term for further keywords which are displayed one level below and slightly to the left of the parent keyword. The different actions that can be performed with breakpoints, for example, such as setting or disabling them, etc., are indicated below the 'Breakpoints' keyword. 

 By double-clicking the desired keyword with the left mouse button, you can display the help text associated with this keyword in the main window of the on-line help. </p>
<p>If you could not find the required information with the <b>Index</b> tab functions, you can go to the <b>Search</b> tab to search the complete on-line help for any desired term. 

 To do this, enter the search term in the <b>Type in the keyword to find</b> field and click the <b>List Topics</b> button. 

 If the search was successful, all sections of the on-line help in which the term was found are displayed in the <b>Select Topic to display</b> list box. Double-click a section, or highlight the section and click the <b>Display</b> button to show it in the main window of the on-line help. All places at which the search term was found in the section are highlighted in color.</p>
<h3><a name="Links"></a>References in the Help Texts</h3>
<p>You will often find references to related topics in the help texts. Such references are called 'hyperlinks'. Hyperlinks are displayed underlined and in color. When you place the mouse pointer on a hyperlink, the mouse pointer changes to the hand symbol <img src="hand.gif" width="19" height="23" align="absmiddle">. <br> To jump to the topic referenced by the hyperlink, click the hyperlink with the left mouse button. With the <b>Back</b> button on the toolbar or with the <b>Back</b> option in the <b>context</b> menu of the help page, you can go back to the previous topic.</p>
<h3><a name="icons"></a>Symbols in the Help Texts</h3>
<P>To draw your attention to particularly important text sections, they are identified by a symbol and a different text color.</p>
<P class="zusammenhalten"><b>Notes</b> are identified by a symbol with a blue exclamation mark and the text color blue: </p>
<img src="note.gif"
        width="32" height="32" align="left"> 
<div style="margin-left: 5; position: relative; top: 0"> 

 <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="tabhinweis">

   <tr> 

     <td class="HinweisText"> This is a note.</td>

   </tr>

 </table>
</div>
<p class="zusammenhalten"><b>Warnings</b> are identified by a yellow warning triangle and the text color red:</p>
<img src="warning.gif"
        width="32" height="33" align="left"> 
<div style="margin-left: 5; position: relative; top: 0"> 

 <table border="0" cellpadding="0" class="tabhinweis">

   <tr> 

     <td class="AchtungText"> This is a warning.</td>

   </tr>

 </table>
</div>
<p>You can perform most actions in ATCM CONTROL by using various controls, such as menu options, toolbar icons, keyboard input, etc. To give you a quick overview of the controls that are available, they are identified by the corresponding symbols: </p>
<img src="menu.gif"
        width="39" height="33" align="left"> 
<div style="margin-left: 5; position: relative; top: 0">

<h3><a name="Clipboard"></a>Copying Text from the On-Line Help to the Clipboard</h3>
<p>If you want to copy help texts to the clipboard in order to use them in other applications or if you want to copy code examples in ST to the clipboard for use in your programs, highlight the desired text and press the <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;C&gt;</b> keys or click the highlighted text with the right mouse button and select the <b>Copy</b> option in the <b>context</b> menu. The text is stored to the clipboard.</p>
<p>To paste the text from the clipboard into the target application, place the mouse pointer at the desired paste position in the target application and press the <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;V&gt;</b> keys. Most applications also offer a <b>Paste</b> option on the menu bar and/or in the <b>context</b> menu.</p>
<h3><a name="ShowHide"></a>Displaying and Hiding the Navigation Bar</h3>
<p>If you need more space on your screen to display the help texts, you can hide the navigation bar on the left side of the on-line help. </p>
<table>

 <tr> 

   <td valign="top"><img src="ichide.gif" width="69" height="40"></td>

   <td valign="top"> 

     <p style="margin-left: 5px">Click the <b>Hide</b> button to hide the navigation bar.</p>

   </td>

 <tr> 

   <td valign="top"><img src="icshow.gif" width="69" height="40"></td>

   <td valign="top"> 

     <p style="margin-left: 5px">If you want to display the navigation bar again, click the <b>Show</b> button.</p>

   </td>

 </tr>
</table>
<h3><a name="FontSize"></a>Changing the Type Size of the Help Pages</h3>
<p>The type size in which the texts of the help pages are displayed cannot be changed in the on-line help. You need to make this change in the <b>Internet Explorer</b>. Do the following:</p>
<ol>

 <li>Open the <b>Internet Explorer</b>.<br> <br>

 </li>

 <li>Select the <b>Text Size</b> option in the <b>View</b> menu of the Internet Explorer.<br> <br>

 </li>

 <li>A submenu opens in which you can choose from the text sizes <b>Largest</b>, <b>Larger</b>, <b>Medium</b>, <b>Smaller</b> and <b>Smallest</b>. Click a text size to select it. <br> <br>

 </li>

 <li>You can now see the changed text size in the representation of the help text in the Internet Explorer (unless the author of the page currently opened in the Internet Explorer has defined a fixed text size and thus prevented text size changes). In the on-line help, changing the text size only becomes effective after a restart. Therefore, close the on-line help and open it again. The text in the help pages is now displayed in the size you selected in the Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="Print"></a>Printing a Help Topic</h3>
<p>To print a help topic, click the <b>Print</b> icon on the toolbar or select the <b>Print</b> option in the <b>context</b> menu. </p>
<table>

 <tr> 

   <td valign="top"><img src="icprint.gif" width="69" height="40"></td>

   <td valign="top"> 

     <p style="margin-left: 5px">Click the <b>Print</b> button to print the topic that is currently displayed in the main window of the on-line help.</p>

   </td>

 </tr>
</table>
<p>If the <b>Contents</b> tab is on top in the navigation bar, you can open its <b>context</b> menu to print a help topic even if it is not currently shown in the main on-line help window. To do this, click the right mouse button on the desired topic in the tree structure of the <b>Contents</b> tab and select the <b>Print</b> option in the <b>context</b> menu.</p>
<p>In both cases, i.e. whether you use the <b>Print</b> icon or the <b>context</b> menu for printing, a dialog box opens in which you can select the scope of the contents to be printed.</p>
<img src="print.gif" width="305" height="175" class="InP"> 
<p>The options that are available in the dialog box depend on whether you have started the print operation with the <b>Print</b> button or the <b>Print</b> option of the <b>context</b> menu:</p>
<ul>

 <li>If you use the <b>Print</b> button to start printing, selecting the <b>Print the selected topic</b> option prints only the help page that is currently displayed in the main window of the on-line help. When you select the <b>Print the selected heading and all subtopics</b> option, all help pages for the subtopics associated with the currently displayed help page topic are printed in addition to the displayed help page.<br> <br>

 </li>

 <li>If you use the <b>context</b> menu to start printing and the <b>Contents</b> tab is on top, selecting the <b>Print the selected topic</b> option prints only the help page for the topic that is currently highlighted on the <b>Contents</b> tab. When you select the <b>Print the selected heading and all subtopics</b> option, the help pages for all subtopics of the topic highlighted on the Contents tab are printed in addition to this topic.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="version"></a>Windows Language Versions</h3>
<p class="zusammenhalten">Depending on the language version (e.g. English, German or Italian) in which you have installed Windows on your PC, the system messages will be displayed in the language you have set in your Windows version. Likewise, the language in which the text appears on the standard controls, such as the controls for confirming or canceling an action in a dialog box, may differ according to the Windows version installed. If you have installed an English version of Windows, for example, the button for canceling an action is labeled <strong>Cancel</strong>, whereas this button is labeled <strong>Abbrechen</strong> if you have installed a German version.<br> Please note that the messages and button labels which are described in the help text or appear in the screenshots of the help might be displayed in a different language on your system.
