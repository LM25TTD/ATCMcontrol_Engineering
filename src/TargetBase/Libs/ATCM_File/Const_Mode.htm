<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The access mode constants are assigned to the <i><b>MODE</b></i>
parameter of the <a href="F_SYNC_FILE.htm"><b><i>F_SYNC_FILE</i></b></a>
structures which represents a file object. This parameter always needs
to be set for the file object passed to these blocks before an access
cycle is initialized with&nbsp;<a href="FA_ASYNC_OPENFILE.htm"><b><i></i></b></a><i><b><a
 href="F_SYNC_OPENFILE.htm">F_SYNC_OPENFILE</a></b></i>. </p>
<p>With the <i><b>MODE</b></i> parameter you define the access
authorization for a file. If the parameter <i><b>MODE</b></i> of a
file object was initialized, for example, with the value <i> <b>CF_READ</b></i>
before being passed to <i><b>F_SYNC_OPENFILE</b></i>, access to this
file object is read-only. A write access will generate an error. </p>
<p>An access mode set in <i><b>MODE</b></i> is effective only if it
was set for the passed file object <u>before being passed</u> to&nbsp;
<i><b>F_SYNC_OPENFILE</b></i>. An access mode set in the initialization
of an access cycle is effective for the duration of a complete access
cycle. Changes to the value of <i><b>MODE</b></i> within an access
cycle thus have no effect. To allow write access to a file opened with<i><b>
CF_READ</b></i> for read-only access after this file has been read, the
file therefore needs to be closed first and then reopened after
changing the <i> <b>MODE</b></i> parameter of the file object. </p>
<p>The access mode also defines the position of the file pointer after
opening a file.</p>
<p>To the access mode constants <i><b>CF_READ</b></i> and <i><b>CF_READ_WRITE</b></i>
the value <a href="Const_Pos.htm#bof"><i><b>CF_BOF</b></i></a> is
assigned. On opening a file, this value causes the file pointer to be
positioned at the beginning of the file. </p>
<p>When opening a file for read and write access with the access mode <i><b>CF_READ_WRITE</b></i>,
please note that the file pointer will also always be located at the
beginning of file if an existing file has been opened. A write access
performed immediately on opening the file therefore always overwrites
the contents of the opened file up to the position of the newly written
contents. To add contents to a file that has been opened with <i><b>CF_READ_WRITE</b></i>
without overwriting existing contents, you therefore need to place the
file pointer at the end of file <u>before the write access</u>. This
is done by setting the parameter <i><b>POSITION</b></i> of the
structure instance (of <i><b>F_SYNC_FILE</b></i>) that represents the
file to <i><b><a href="Const_Pos.htm#eof">CF_EOF</a></b></i>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> To the access mode constant <i><b>CF_APPEND </b></i>the value <a
 href="Const_Pos.htm#eof"><b><i>CF_EOF</i></b></a> is assigned. On
opening a file, this value causes the file pointer to be positioned at
the end of the file. A write access performed immediately on opening
the file therefore always appends new data to the end of the file
without overwriting existing data. </p>
<p>The file pointer position that is set with the definition of the
access mode when a file is opened overwrites the value of the structure
element <i><b>POSITION</b></i> of a structure instance of <i><b><a
 href="FA_ASYNC_FILE.htm"></a></b></i><i><b><a href="F_SYNC_FILE.htm">F_SYNC_FILE</a></b></i>.
On opening a file, the file pointer therefore is always set to the
position that is defined by the access mode, regardless of the value
that has been set in <i><b>POSITION</b></i> in the structure instance
passed to the opening block. If a file operation is to be executed
explicitly at a specific file position, the value of <i><b>POSITION</b></i>
therefore must be newly set after the file has been opened. </p>
