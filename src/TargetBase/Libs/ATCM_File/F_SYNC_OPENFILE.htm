<h3><a name="Description"></a>Description</h3>
<p><i><b>F_SYNC_OPENFILE </b></i>opens the file passed to <i><b>FILE</b></i>
for read or write access. <i><b>F_SYNC_OPENFILE </b></i>initiates an
access cycle and therefore must always be called before a read or write
access can be executed via other function block instances of the group
of blocks for elementary synchronous file operations. </p>
<p>The file to be opened is represented by an instance of the <a
 href="F_SYNC_FILE.htm"><i><b>F_SYNC_FILE</b></i></a> structure. This
structure contains the <b><i>MODE</i></b> element with which you
define the access mode a file is to be opened with. The possible values
are defined in the <a href="Const_Mode.htm">access mode constants</a>.
</p>
<p>Before you open a file, you need to set the access mode in the
structure instance of <i><b>F_SYNC_FILE</b></i> passed to <i><b>F_SYNC_OPENFILE</b></i>.
The access mode set during opening remains in effect until the file is
closed again with <i><b>F_SYNC_CLOSEFILE</b></i>. All functions which
are called between the opening and closing of a file and which work on
the file object passed to <i><b>F_SYNC_OPENFILE</b></i> are subject to
the access authorizations that have been set in <i><b>MODE</b></i>
when opening the file. </p>
<p>When a file is opened, the position of th file pointer always
depends on the access mode, which is set in the instance of <i><b>F_SYNC_FILE</b></i>
passed to <i><b>F_SYNC_OPENFILE</b></i>. When opening a file with <i><b>F_SYNC_OPENFILE</b></i>,
an initialization of the element variable <i><b>POSITION</b></i> of
the <i><b>F_SYNC_FILE</b></i> structure with a user-defined value is
overwritten by the value that is assigned to the corresponding access
mode. If a file access is to be executed at a specific position after
having opened the file, you therefore need to explicitly set the value
of <i><b>POSITION</b></i> anew <u>after opening</u>. </p>
