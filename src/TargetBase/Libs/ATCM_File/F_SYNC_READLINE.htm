<h3>Description</h3>
<p><b><i>F_SYNC_READFILE</i></b> reads reads a line from the file passed to <i><b>FILE</b></i> depending on the max length
  of string passed in <i><b>DATA</b></i>.
Before reading a file, the file must be opened with <i><b><a
 href="F_SYNC_OPENFILE.htm">F_SYNC_OPENFILE</a></b></i>. Before you
open the file, you need to set the access mode in the <i><b>MODE</b></i>
parameter of the structure instance of <i><b><a href="F_SYNC_FILE.htm">F_SYNC_FILE</a></b></i>
that is passed to <i> <b>F_SYNC_OPENFILE</b></i>. </p>
<p>The line is read until the
first newline character (0A hex, 10 dec) and this character will be included
into <b><i>DATA</i></b> string.<p>
<p>The file pointer which indicates the current read position is
represented by the structure variable <i> <b>POSITION</b></i> of the
structure instance of <i><b>F_SYNC_FILE</b></i> passed to <i><b>FILE</b></i>.
</p>
<p>After opening a file, the file pointer is always set to the position
defined by the <a href="Const_Mode.htm">access mode</a> when opening
the file. A subsequent read access is therefore always performed at the
position defined by the access mode unless the file pointer has been
explicitly set to a different position (see next paragraph). After each
read access, the value of <i><b>POSITION</b></i> is automatically set
to a position directly after the last byte read. This allows you to
sequentially read out a file without having to explicitly set the file
pointer to the new position. </p>
<p>The position of a read access can be explicitly set by assigning a
value to the structure variable <i> <b>POSITION</b></i>. For this
purpose, the value of <i><b>POSITION</b></i> must be set to the
desired reading position after opening a file and before the write
access. On conclusion of the reading operation, the value of <i><b>POSITION</b></i>
is again set to the position directly after the last byte read. </p>
